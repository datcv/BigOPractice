# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.  

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.  

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.  
**Example 1:**  
```
Input: 1->1->2  
Output: 1->2  
```

**Example 2:**  
```
Input: 1->1->2->3->3  
Output: 1->2->3  
```
